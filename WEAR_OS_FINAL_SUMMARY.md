## 🎨 What Was Built

### 1. Authentication System ✅
**Location**: `wear/src/main/kotlin/com/metrolist/wear/auth/AuthRepository.kt`

- ✅ **Credential Manager Integration**: Uses Android's official API
- ✅ **Remote Auth Support**: Delegates to paired phone (no typing on watch!)
- ✅ **Google Sign-In**: Full OAuth 2.0 flow
- ✅ **Demo Mode**: Test without configuration
- ✅ **Persistent State**: DataStore for credential storage
- ✅ **Observable State**: Flow-based reactive state

```kotlin
suspend fun signIn(): SignInResult
suspend fun signInDemo(): SignInResult
suspend fun signOut()
val userState: Flow<UserState>
```

### 2. UI Screens ✅
**Location**: `wear/src/main/kotlin/com/metrolist/wear/ui/screens/`

#### SignInScreen.kt
- Material Design for Wear OS
- Two sign-in options: Remote Auth + Demo Mode
- Loading states with progress indicator
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Guidance text for Remote Auth

#### AccountScreen.kt
- User profile display (name, email, ID)
- Sign-out functionality
- Clean, card-based layout

#### BrowseScreen.kt (Enhanced)
- Added "Account" menu item
- Navigation to account management
- Maintains all existing functionality

### 3. Navigation System ✅
**Location**: `wear/src/main/kotlin/com/metrolist/wear/navigation/WearNavigation.kt`

- SwipeDismissableNavHost for Wear OS
- Auth-aware routing
- Proper backstack management
- Screen state coordination

### 4. Main Integration ✅
**Location**: `wear/src/main/kotlin/com/metrolist/wear/MainActivity.kt`

- Hilt dependency injection
- Auth state observation
- Screen routing logic
- Proper state management

### 5. Documentation ✅

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Dependencies Added
```kotlin
// Credential Manager for authentication
implementation("androidx.credentials:credentials:1.5.0")
implementation("androidx.credentials:credentials-play-services-auth:1.5.0")
```

### Key Technologies
- **Credential Manager**: Android's official authentication API
- **Remote Auth**: Phone delegation for Wear OS
- **DataStore**: Persistent credential storage
- **Kotlin Flows**: Reactive state management
- **Hilt**: Dependency injection
- **Jetpack Compose**: UI framework
- **Wear Compose**: Wear OS specific components

### Architecture Patterns
- **Repository Pattern**: Centralized data access
- **State Management**: Flow-based reactive state
- **Dependency Injection**: Hilt for lifecycle management
- **MVVM-like**: Composable UI with observable state

## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Start (Demo Mode)
```bash
1. Build and install: ./gradlew :wear:installDebug
2. Launch the app on Wear OS device/emulator
3. Tap "Demo Mode" button
4. Explore the full UI without configuration!
```

### Production Setup (Real Authentication)
```bash
1. Set up Google Cloud OAuth 2.0 client ID
2. Update client ID in AuthRepository.kt
3. Test on paired Wear OS device
4. Complete sign-in flow on phone
```

See `wear/AUTHENTICATION.md` for detailed setup instructions.
